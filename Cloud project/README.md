Cloud Computing Project
Description: Type a command on host only and it executes commands on 3 different guest OS VMs. The guest OS can be Linux (any flavor) or Windows XP, still the commands execute. Linux commands like “ls” for the common command interface get executed as “dir” on Windows type machines. Shows different interesting scenarios like:
1) Obtaining current resource utilization of all virtual machines and storing them in a file
2) Taking snapshot of all VMs
3) Creating files on all VMs
4) Deleting all .txt files in a folder
