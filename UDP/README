Description: This project builds a simple Client-Server program using UDP. It handles serialization, logging at server and client sides and exceptions like Server Timeout, Unrequested Packet and Malformed Request.

## The src folder contains all the .java files and server and client log files
## The bin folder contains the binaries and UDP client and server .jar files

## To build UDPClient and UDPServer, run the Makefile from the src folder in UDP folder.

$ cd src
$ make

## This will build UDPClient and UDPServer as different .jar files which can be deployed
## to separate hosts independent of each other.

### Running client and server both on local machine
## To run the UDPServer, run from the src folder.
	java -cp ../bin/UDPServer.jar UDPServer 1234

## To run the UDPCLient, run from the src folder.
	java -cp ../bin/UDPClient.jar UDPClient localhost 1234

### Running client and server on different remote machines
## To run the UDPServer, copy jar to remote host and run following.
	java -cp UDPServer.jar UDPServer 1234

## To run the UDPClient, copy jar to remote host and run following.
	java -cp UDPClient.jar UDPClient <SERVER_HOSTNAME> 1234
